I started out on The Odin Project. I currently am in contract with a job not related to code or software engineering, although it is
a difficult job that required years of training (not college) and is definitely taxing. Whenever I leave this field I want to put what I've
learned to good use, with the help of the community of GitHub, to provide for my family and myself.

I play on PC and PS4 and I want to live in the mountains when I retire.
